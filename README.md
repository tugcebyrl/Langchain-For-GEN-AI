# Langchain-For-GEN-AI

* LangChain is a Python library for developing language modeling and artificial intelligence-based applications. 

* LangChain enables the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) more effectively and flexibly.

* LangChain allows combining multiple steps into a chain. For example, it can take input from a user and produce an output based on this input.

* A simple example of LLM and NLP tools and models developed on the OpenAI and Hugging Face Hub platforms is given.
